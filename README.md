# 🐛 Welcome to the Bug Factory! (a.k.a. my GitHub)


👋 **Oh hey there!** You’ve wandered into my chaotic corner of the web, where bugs are born, tamed, and sometimes accidentally released back into the wild. (OOPS 🤭) 

---

## 🌟 Who am I?  
Just your friendly neighborhood bug breeder, endlessly experimenting with code and hoping something works before my coffee runs out. Sure, I fix bugs... but let's be real—I'm *exceptionally* good at making them too.  

---

## 🚀 What I do here:  
- Write **Golang**, **JavaScript**, and make **Node.js** cry until it complies.  
- Build **React frontends** that are as stable as my Wi-Fi (read: *not always*).  
- Turn **Docker containers** into beautifully chaotic stacks.  
- Break **SQLite** and then Google “how to SQLite”.  
- Argue with my shell while trying to write **Bash scripts**.  

---

## 🌱 What I’m learning:  
Currently mastering the fine art of **Bash scripting**—because nothing says fun like accidentally deleting the wrong directory with a mistyped `rm -rf`. Also exploring **virtual machines**, tweaking configs until they scream, and setting up infrastructure that (hopefully) doesn’t crash when someone sneezes. Let’s just say my debugging toolkit now includes a healthy dose of trial, error, and existential questioning.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools of the trade:  
💻 **Code:** Golang, JavaScript, React, Node.js, HTML, CSS  
📦 **Containers:** Docker (for stacking bugs neatly)  
📂 **Data wrangling:** SQLite  
⚙️ **Script-fu:** Shell, Bash (where most of my accidental bugs begin)  

---

## 🤹 Fun facts:  
- I create bugs faster than I can fix them, but hey, it’s job security!  
- Fluent in **Eesti keel 🇪🇪**, **English 🇬🇧**, and an impressive 404-level knowledge of **French 🇫🇷**, **Italian 🇮🇹**, and **sign language 🤟**.  
- My debugging process is 90% Googling and 10% panicking.

## 📬 How to find me:  
- ✉️ **Email:** [Kaileen.umal@gmail.com]  
- 💼 **LinkedIn:** [Kaileen Umal] ] (Warning: I check it about as often as I win the lottery, so patience is key!)

✨ Thanks for visiting! If you spot a bug in my repos, congrats—it’s probably intentional (let’s go with that). Feel free to fork, fix, or laugh at my code. Happy coding! 🐞
