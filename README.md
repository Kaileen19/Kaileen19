# 🐛 Welcome to the Bug Factory! (a.k.a. my GitHub)

👋 **Oh hey there!** Welcome to my little corner of GitHub, where I write code, fix bugs, and occasionally create new ones (it’s all part of the process, right?).

---

## 🌟 Who am I?  
I’m a developer who enjoys experimenting with new technologies and turning ideas into working code. Bugs? They’re just unplanned features that keep things exciting.

---

## 🚀 What I do here:  
- Write **Golang** and **JavaScript**, and make **Node.js** work (eventually).  
- Build **React frontends** that usually behave themselves.  
- Create and manage **Docker containers**, sometimes forgetting where I put them.  
- Work with **SQLite** while pretending to be a database expert.  
- Write **Bash scripts**, occasionally arguing with my terminal along the way.  

---

## 🌱 What I’m learning:  
Currently focused on improving my **Bash scripting** skills, especially when it comes to automating tasks and managing systems more efficiently. I’m also diving into **virtual machines** and fine-tuning configurations to ensure smooth performance. Setting up reliable infrastructure is a constant learning process, and I’m always refining my approach through hands-on experience and troubleshooting.

## 🛠️ Tools of the trade:  
💻 **Code:** Golang, JavaScript, React, Node.js, HTML, CSS  
📦 **Containers:** Docker  
📂 **Databases:** SQLite  
⚙️ **Scripting:** Shell, Bash

## 🤹 Fun facts:  
- I speak multiple languages, both human (**Eesti keel**, **English**, and some **French**, **Italian**, and **sign language**) and machine.  
- Debug
